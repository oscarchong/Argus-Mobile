App temporarily named "argus"

To set up the development environment, Android Studio and the Android Studio mobile emulator must be running. Follow the steps at https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html, specific to your system's OS, all the way *until* "Creating a new application." Instead, open terminal/command prompt with this repo as the active directory, and run `react-native run-android`. 

To show console logs for debugging while the app is running, open another terminal first to run `react-native log-android`, then another terminal and run `react-native run-android`.
